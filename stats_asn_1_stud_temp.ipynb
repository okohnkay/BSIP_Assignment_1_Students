    "# Assignment #1 - Basic Data Exploration in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you'll load some data into a python notebook, and use some basic functions to do some basic analysis. Each section asks you to either calculate some answers or explore some information found in the data. When generating your answers, try to think about a few factors that can make your code better:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Present the answers clearly. Use the markdown cells, code comments, and formatting to help make your answers readable. One of the features of notebooks is that they allow us to combine code and commentary, and we need to ensure both are readable. Refer to the guide in the guides folder of the exercises workbook for an explaination and examples of different formatting. \n",
    "<li> Make your code clear. It is easy to make sense of small pieces of code, for short periods of time, so if your code makes little sense here, it won't really hurt your ability to find the answers. If you need to come back to it later, or others need to edit it, having code that doesn't make sense is a big issue. Use things like clearly named variables, comments, and spacing to make things readable. Even in this course, if you are looking back to something from 2 months ago for the project, it is far easier to understand code that is cleaned up a little. \n",
    "<li> Structure the code well. If there is some kind of repetitive task, it should likely be moved into a function. If there is something that happens several times, it should be in a loop. Having well structured code makes it easy to reuse stuff later, understand how things work, debug errors, and share code with others. This is something to keep in the back of your minds, right now you may not have much experience to lean on to judge how things should be, as you read, adjust, and write code it will become more clear. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Peer Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignemnt will have a peer evaluation for the grade - you'll each read some other notebooks and evaluate their answers. The reason for this is not (entirely) my personal laziness, we are hoping to accomplish a couple of things:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Quick experience reading notebooks. One of the important skills we need to have is the ability to read examples that we find and adapting it to our scenario. This is practice with data you're now comfortable with.\n",
    "<li> Critically evaluating what makes sense in a data notebook. You know how you attempted to explain your look at the data, how did other people do it? What was better? What was worse?\n",
    "<li> Design is subjective. This will give you a set of opinions that are not mine. You will end up with plenty of feedback of what I think, feadback of others early-on should hopefully help you make things appealing to all and not tailored to me. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "Doing this right up front will hopefully help kickstart some of that expericence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed grading is defined in the marking guide in the Moodle workshop. Note that there's points both for getting a correct answer and for presenting it in a way that makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section contains a set of questions/prompts and a rough framework for your responses. You can change the structure around, just make sure it is readable. What I have there is just a loose guide to help get you started, you're not bound to it. "
